## 🎮 How to Play

1. Run the Python file in your terminal:
2. Enter your choice: rock, paper, or scissors
3. The computer makes its move randomly
   You'll see:
   Your and the computer's moves as colorful ASCII art
   A message indicating whether you won, lost, or it's a tie

##  🧠 What I Learned
  -Applying Python basics in a creative way
  -Using loops and conditional logic to build gameplay
  -Displaying colored text using ANSI escape sequences (\033)
  -Enhancing user experience with emojis and ASCII art

 ## 🔧 Future Improvements
  -Add a player vs player mode
  -Support custom rounds (e.g. best of 5, 7, 10)
  -Add scoreboard or leaderboard feature
  -Build a GUI version using tkinter or a web version using Flask
